# keepsake
A photo sharing app that uses MultipeerConnectivity to share images among nearby users and Core Data to save images to the device. 

Keepsake allows users to choose photos from their photo library (using a UIImagePicker) or to take a photo using their device's camera, and then share the photo with connected users. The images are saved as NSData in Core Data and then fetched and displayed.
